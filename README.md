## Project-X

We are creating a site to help people new at coding get help in areas they are struggling with. They will access to videos on the subject they want help in. They can post questions for other users or “mentors” to answer and provide tips that they think will be helpful to new coders. If the video doesn’t cover their questions, they can narrow their search and find help on stack overflow.
